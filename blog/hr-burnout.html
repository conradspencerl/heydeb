            <h1>HR Burnout Is Real: Signs You're Drowning and What to Do</h1>

            <p>HR professionals care for everyone else. Who cares for HR?</p>
            <p>The uncomfortable truth: HR burnout is at an all-time high. You're managing other people's stress while absorbing it yourself. You're the dumping ground for every workplace problem. And you're expected to do it all with a smile and open-door policy.</p>
            <p>Let's talk honestly about HR burnout — what it looks like, why it happens, and what you can actually do about it.</p>

            <h2>The Warning Signs</h2>
            <p>Burnout doesn't happen overnight. It creeps up. Here's what it looks like:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Emotional exhaustion:</strong> You dread opening Slack. Every ping feels like an attack.</li>
                <li><strong>Cynicism:</strong> You've started mentally classifying employees as "problems." You used to like people.</li>
                <li><strong>Reduced effectiveness:</strong> Tasks that used to take 30 minutes now take 2 hours. You're slower. Foggier.</li>
                <li><strong>Physical symptoms:</strong> Headaches, sleep problems, getting sick more often.</li>
                <li><strong>Detachment:</strong> You're going through the motions. The passion is gone.</li>
                <li><strong>Inability to disconnect:</strong> You check email at 11 PM. You think about work constantly.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Sound familiar? You're not alone.</p>

            <h2>Why HR Burns Out Faster</h2>
            <h3>Emotional Labor is Your Entire Job</h3>
            <p>You absorb everyone's stress, complaints, and crises. That's literally the work. But nobody is absorbing yours.</p>

            <h3>You Can't Talk About It</h3>
            <p>HR has to maintain confidentiality. You can't vent about the thing that's stressing you to colleagues who might be involved.</p>

            <h3>Constant Context Switching</h3>
            <p>Benefits question. Recruiting call. Employee complaint. Payroll issue. Policy question. All in one hour. Your brain never settles.</p>

            <h3>No Backup</h3>
            <p>Many HR teams are just one person. There's no coverage. The work never stops.</p>

            <h3>You're the Fixer</h3>
            <p>People only come to HR when something's wrong. You rarely get to celebrate wins. Just solve problems.</p>

            <h2>What Actually Helps</h2>

            <h3>1. Set Real Boundaries</h3>
            <p>Not theoretical boundaries. Real ones. "I don't respond to Slack after 6 PM" — and actually do it.</p>

            <h3>2. Automate the Repetitive Stuff</h3>
            <p>Every PTO question you don't have to answer is emotional energy saved. Automate what you can.</p>

            <h3>3. Find Your People</h3>
            <p>Other HR professionals who understand. Communities like HR Twitter, local SHRM chapters, or Slack groups for HR folks.</p>

            <h3>4. Block Focus Time</h3>
            <p>Constant interruptions are burnout accelerators. Block time for deep work and protect it.</p>

            <h3>5. Take Your Own PTO</h3>
            <p>HR is often the worst at taking their own time off. Practice what you preach.</p>

            <h3>6. Ask for Help</h3>
            <p>Tell leadership what you need. More headcount, better tools, different priorities. They can't help if they don't know.</p>

            <div class="cta-box">
                <h3>Let Deb take some of the load</h3>
                <p>She handles the repetitive questions — PTO, benefits, policies — so you have space to breathe.</p>

            </div>

            <h2>When It's Time to Make a Change</h2>
            <p>Sometimes the environment is the problem. Signs it might be time to move on:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Leadership doesn't respect HR's role or needs</li>
                <li>The workload is impossible and nobody cares</li>
                <li>You've tried boundaries and they're not respected</li>
                <li>Your health is suffering and nothing is changing</li>
            </ul>
            <p>You can't fix a company that doesn't want to be fixed.</p>

            <h2>A Note of Validation</h2>
            <p>If you're burned out, it's not because you're weak or bad at your job. It's because the job is genuinely hard, often thankless, and frequently under-resourced.</p>
            <p>Take care of yourself. You can't pour from an empty cup — and HR people say that to everyone else while ignoring it themselves.</p>
