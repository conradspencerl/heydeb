            <h1>"How Many PTO Days Do I Have?" — Why This Question Is Killing Your HR Team</h1>

            <p>If you work in HR at a SaaS company, you've probably answered this question today. Maybe twice. Maybe seven times. Maybe you've lost count.</p>

            <p><strong>"How many PTO days do I have left?"</strong></p>

            <p>It's not a hard question. It's not a sensitive question. It's not even a question that requires human judgment. And yet, here you are, pulling up Rippling for the 47th time this week to tell someone they have 12 days left.</p>

            <p>This is not what you signed up for.</p>

            <h2>The Hidden Cost of "Quick Questions"</h2>

            <p>Let's do some math that will make you want to cry (or maybe validate the crying you're already doing):</p>

            <ul>
                <li><strong>Average time to answer a PTO balance question:</strong> 3-5 minutes (including context switching, looking it up, typing the response, and the inevitable follow-up)</li>
                <li><strong>Average number of PTO questions per week</strong> for a 100-person company: 15-25</li>
                <li><strong>That's 75-125 minutes per week</strong> — or roughly 2 hours — spent on a question that literally has a number as the answer</li>
            </ul>

            <p>Now multiply that across a year. <span class="highlight">That's over 100 hours annually</span> — two and a half full work weeks — spent copying numbers from one screen to another.</p>

            <p>But wait, it gets worse.</p>

            <h2>The Context-Switching Tax</h2>

            <p>The real killer isn't the 3 minutes it takes to answer. It's the 23 minutes it takes to get back to whatever you were actually working on.</p>

            <p>Studies show that after an interruption, it takes an average of <strong>23 minutes to fully return to a task</strong>. So that "quick PTO question" isn't costing you 3 minutes. It's costing you 26 minutes.</p>

            <p>Every. Single. Time.</p>

            <p>Now do that math again and try not to flip a table.</p>

            <h2>Why Employees Keep Asking (It's Not Their Fault)</h2>

            <p>Before we go further, let's be clear: your employees aren't trying to annoy you. They're asking because:</p>

            <ol>
                <li><strong>Your HRIS is confusing.</strong> They logged in once, couldn't find it, and gave up.</li>
                <li><strong>They're not sure which balance matters.</strong> Accrued? Available? Pending? Carryover?</li>
                <li><strong>You're faster than figuring it out.</strong> Slack you → get answer in 2 minutes. Self-serve → ??? → frustration → Slack you anyway.</li>
                <li><strong>They've forgotten the HRIS exists.</strong> They use it during onboarding and then never again.</li>
            </ol>

            <p>The problem isn't your employees. The problem is that asking you is the path of least resistance.</p>

            <h2>The Domino Effect</h2>

            <p>PTO questions are just the gateway drug. Once employees realize you're faster than the HRIS, the floodgates open:</p>

            <ul>
                <li>"Hey, does our dental cover Invisalign?"</li>
                <li>"What's the policy on working from another country?"</li>
                <li>"When do I become eligible for 401k matching?"</li>
                <li>"How do I add my spouse to my insurance?"</li>
                <li>"Can you remind me how to submit expenses?"</li>
            </ul>

            <p>Before you know it, your entire job becomes human-HRIS-interface. You're not doing HR anymore — you're a search engine with feelings.</p>

            <h2>Why "Just Google It" Doesn't Work</h2>

            <p>You've tried everything:</p>

            <ul>
                <li><strong>Wiki pages</strong> — they get outdated, and nobody reads them</li>
                <li><strong>Notion docs</strong> — buried under 47 other pages</li>
                <li><strong>Pinned Slack messages</strong> — lost in the noise after a week</li>
                <li><strong>FAQ documents</strong> — lol</li>
            </ul>

            <p>The reality is that static documentation doesn't work because employees don't want to search. They want answers. There's a difference.</p>

            <h2>The Real Solution: Make Asking Someone Else Easier Than Asking You</h2>

            <p>The only way to escape the PTO question purgatory is to give employees something that's:</p>

            <ol>
                <li><strong>Faster than messaging you</strong></li>
                <li><strong>Available 24/7</strong> (unlike you, who deserves to log off)</li>
                <li><strong>Actually accurate</strong> (no outdated wiki pages)</li>
                <li><strong>In the tools they already use</strong> (Slack, Teams, etc.)</li>
            </ol>

            <p>This is exactly why we built Deb.</p>

            <div class="cta-box">
                <h3>Deb answers "how many PTO days do I have?" so you never have to again.</h3>
                <p>She connects to your HRIS, knows your policies, and lives in Slack. Employees ask her instead of you.</p>
                <a href="../#cta">Join the Waitlist</a>
            </div>

            <h2>What Your Day Could Look Like</h2>

            <p>Imagine this: It's 9:30 AM. You're working on that compensation analysis that's been on your to-do list for three weeks. Someone has a PTO question.</p>

            <p>But instead of pinging you, they ask Deb.</p>

            <p>Deb checks their balance in Rippling, tells them they have 12 days, and asks if they want to submit a request. They say yes. Deb submits it and notifies their manager.</p>

            <p>You never even know it happened. You keep working on that analysis. You finish it before lunch. You feel like a functioning human being.</p>

            <p>That's the dream. And it's possible.</p>

            <h2>The Bottom Line</h2>

            <p>PTO balance questions aren't hard. They're just frequent. And frequency without automation equals burnout.</p>

            <p>You became an HR professional to work with people, not to be a human database lookup. Every minute you spend answering "how many days do I have?" is a minute you're not spending on recruiting, culture, employee development, or literally anything that requires human judgment.</p>

            <p>The question isn't whether you should automate this. It's why haven't you already.</p>
