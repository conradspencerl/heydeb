            <h1>Slack Is Ruining Your HR Team's Productivity</h1>
            <p>You open Slack at 9 AM. You have 47 unread messages. 12 are DMs. 8 of them are HR questions. By 9:30 AM, you've answered zero emails, started zero projects, and typed "let me check on that" six times.</p>
            <p>This is your life now.</p>

            <h2>The Math of Interruption</h2>
            <p>Let's be scientific about this:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Average time to recover from an interruption: <strong>23 minutes</strong></li>
                <li>Average Slack messages received by HR per day: <strong>50-100+</strong></li>
                <li>Average DMs requiring response: <strong>15-30</strong></li>
            </ul>
            <p>If each DM takes you 3 minutes to answer and 23 minutes to recover from, you're spending your entire day just on Slack. That strategic project? It doesn't exist.</p>

            <h2>Why HR Gets Hit Hardest</h2>
            <p>HR is everyone's first stop for questions. Employees don't know the answer? Ask HR. Manager doesn't want to deal with it? Route to HR. New hire needs something? HR.</p>
            <p>You're the default destination for every "I don't know where to ask this" question. And in Slack culture, that means constant pings.</p>

            <h2>The Types of Slack That Kill You</h2>
            <h3>The Quick Question</h3>
            <p>"Hey, quick question..." — It's never quick. It never ends with one question.</p>
            <h3>The Lazy Search</h3>
            <p>"Where do I find the PTO policy?" — It's in the handbook. That you sent them. That's in a pinned message. That they could search for.</p>
            <h3>The Pre-Question Question</h3>
            <p>"Hey, are you free?" — Just ask the question. Don't ask to ask.</p>
            <h3>The Thread That Won't Die</h3>
            <p>17 messages deep on something that should have been an email or a meeting. Or nothing.</p>

            <h2>What Actually Works</h2>
            <h3>1. Create an HR Bot/Channel</h3>
            <p>Route questions to a channel or bot instead of your DMs. This creates visibility and reduces duplicates.</p>
            <h3>2. Set Response Time Expectations</h3>
            <p>"HR responds to Slack within 4 hours for non-urgent matters." Communicate it. Stick to it.</p>
            <h3>3. Batch Your Slack Time</h3>
            <p>Check Slack at specific times instead of constantly. Turn off notifications during focus blocks.</p>
            <h3>4. Redirect, Don't Answer</h3>
            <p>Instead of answering the same question again, point to where the answer lives. Train self-sufficiency.</p>
            <h3>5. Automate the Answering</h3>
            <p>Get an AI assistant that lives in Slack and answers the questions before they reach you.</p>

            <div class="cta-box">
                <h3>Deb lives in Slack so you don't have to</h3>
                <p>Employees ask Deb their HR questions. You get your time back. Everyone wins.</p>
                <a href="../#cta">Join the Waitlist</a>
            </div>

            <h2>The Goal: Async HR</h2>
            <p>The dream isn't zero Slack. It's a world where employees can get answers without synchronously interrupting you. Where self-service is better than asking. Where your DMs are for things that actually need you.</p>
            <p>It's possible. It just requires intention, tools, and the willingness to set boundaries.</p>
