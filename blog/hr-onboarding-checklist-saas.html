            <h1>HR Onboarding Checklist for SaaS Startups: The First 90 Days</h1>

            <p>Onboarding at a SaaS startup is a different beast. You're moving fast, resources are limited, and that new engineer needs to ship code next week while you're still trying to get their I-9 sorted.</p>

            <p>This is the onboarding checklist we wish we had when we were running HR at high-growth startups. It's comprehensive, practical, and acknowledges that you probably don't have a team of 10 HR people to execute it.</p>

            <h2>Before Day 1: The Pre-boarding Essentials</h2>

            <p>Great onboarding starts before the employee walks in (or logs on). Here's what needs to happen between the signed offer and their first day:</p>

            <div class="checklist">
                <h4>Paperwork & Legal (Do First)</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li>Send offer letter and collect signature</li>
                    <li>Send background check authorization</li>
                    <li>Initiate background check</li>
                    <li>Send new hire paperwork packet (tax forms, direct deposit, emergency contact)</li>
                    <li>Collect completed I-9 documents (must be done by Day 3)</li>
                    <li>Send employee handbook acknowledgment</li>
                    <li>Set up employee in HRIS (Rippling, Gusto, BambooHR, etc.)</li>
                    <li>Add to payroll</li>
                </ul>
            </div>

            <div class="checklist">
                <h4>Benefits Enrollment</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li>Send benefits overview packet</li>
                    <li>Schedule benefits enrollment (30-day window usually)</li>
                    <li>Provide benefits portal login credentials</li>
                    <li>Send plan comparison resources</li>
                </ul>
            </div>

            <div class="checklist">
                <h4>Equipment & Access</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li>Order laptop (do this EARLY - shipping takes time)</li>
                    <li>Order any additional equipment (monitors, peripherals)</li>
                    <li>Create company email account</li>
                    <li>Set up SSO/Okta access</li>
                    <li>Add to Slack/Teams</li>
                    <li>Add to relevant Slack channels</li>
                    <li>Set up necessary software licenses</li>
                    <li>Create accounts in core tools (GitHub, Figma, etc.)</li>
                </ul>
            </div>

            <div class="checklist">
                <h4>Manager Prep</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li>Notify manager of start date and logistics</li>
                    <li>Confirm first-week schedule with manager</li>
                    <li>Assign onboarding buddy</li>
                    <li>Schedule first 1:1 for day 2 or 3</li>
                    <li>Prepare role-specific onboarding materials</li>
                </ul>
            </div>

            <h2>Day 1: First Impressions Matter</h2>

            <p>Day 1 sets the tone. It should feel welcoming, organized, and not overwhelming. (Note: "not overwhelming" is aspirational. Do your best.)</p>

            <div class="checklist">
                <h4>Morning</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li>Send welcome message before they start</li>
                    <li>Ensure equipment is ready and working</li>
                    <li>Complete I-9 verification (you have until Day 3, but why wait)</li>
                    <li>HR welcome meeting: company overview, culture, logistics</li>
                    <li>Review employee handbook together</li>
                    <li>Answer initial questions (there will be many)</li>
                </ul>
            </div>

            <div class="checklist">
                <h4>Afternoon</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li>Manager introduction and team welcome</li>
                    <li>Tour of tools: Slack norms, calendar, documentation</li>
                    <li>Onboarding buddy lunch (virtual or in-person)</li>
                    <li>Begin role-specific setup and access</li>
                    <li>Add to team meetings on calendar</li>
                </ul>
            </div>

            <h2>Week 1: Getting Oriented</h2>

            <p>The goal of week 1 is basic competence: Can they find things? Do they know who to ask? Are they set up to actually work?</p>

            <div class="checklist">
                <h4>HR Tasks</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li>Verify I-9 completion (deadline: Day 3)</li>
                    <li>Confirm benefits enrollment started</li>
                    <li>Check in on equipment issues</li>
                    <li>Schedule end-of-week HR check-in</li>
                    <li>Send resources on company policies and norms</li>
                    <li>Introduce to cross-functional partners</li>
                </ul>
            </div>

            <div class="checklist">
                <h4>Manager Tasks (HR Should Enable)</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li>First 1:1 meeting</li>
                    <li>Share 30/60/90 day goals</li>
                    <li>Introduce to key collaborators</li>
                    <li>Assign first project or task</li>
                    <li>Set expectations for communication</li>
                </ul>
            </div>

            <h2>Days 8-30: Building Foundations</h2>

            <p>By now, the new hire should be past the "where is everything" phase and into actual work. Your job is to check in and remove blockers.</p>

            <div class="checklist">
                <h4>Week 2</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li>Benefits enrollment reminder (deadline approaching)</li>
                    <li>Check in on questions about policies</li>
                    <li>Ensure buddy relationship is working</li>
                    <li>Gather initial feedback on onboarding experience</li>
                </ul>
            </div>

            <div class="checklist">
                <h4>Week 3-4</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li>Confirm benefits enrollment completed</li>
                    <li>30-day HR check-in meeting</li>
                    <li>Manager check-in on performance</li>
                    <li>Address any emerging issues</li>
                    <li>Collect formal onboarding feedback</li>
                </ul>
            </div>

            <h2>Days 31-60: Integration</h2>

            <p>At this point, the new hire should be productively contributing. Your involvement shifts from "onboarding" to "ongoing support."</p>

            <div class="checklist">
                <h4>HR Tasks</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li>60-day check-in</li>
                    <li>Review initial feedback and address concerns</li>
                    <li>Ensure they know how to access HR resources</li>
                    <li>Check in with manager on progress</li>
                    <li>Identify any additional training needs</li>
                </ul>
            </div>

            <h2>Days 61-90: Confirmation</h2>

            <p>The 90-day mark is a natural checkpoint. In many companies, it's the end of the probationary period. Make it count.</p>

            <div class="checklist">
                <h4>90-Day Milestone</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li>90-day performance conversation (with manager)</li>
                    <li>90-day HR check-in</li>
                    <li>Comprehensive onboarding feedback survey</li>
                    <li>Confirm probationary period completion (if applicable)</li>
                    <li>Transition to standard employee support</li>
                </ul>
            </div>

            <h2>The Reality: Why Most Onboarding Falls Apart</h2>

            <p>You now have a beautiful checklist. Here's why it won't work perfectly:</p>

            <ol>
                <li><strong>You're doing 17 other things.</strong> Onboarding is important, but so is that compliance deadline, that employee issue, and that recruiting pipeline.</li>
                <li><strong>Managers are inconsistent.</strong> Some are amazing at onboarding. Others forget they have a new hire until Thursday.</li>
                <li><strong>New hires don't read things.</strong> You sent them the handbook. They skimmed page 1 and then asked you everything anyway.</li>
                <li><strong>Every new hire has different questions</strong> at different times. Synchronous support doesn't scale.</li>
            </ol>

            <div class="cta-box">
                <h3>Deb handles the "where do I find..." questions for you</h3>
                <p>New hires ask Deb about policies, benefits, and logistics. You focus on the human side of onboarding.</p>
                <a href="../#cta">Join the Waitlist</a>
            </div>

            <h2>How to Actually Scale Onboarding</h2>

            <h3>1. Automate the Automatable</h3>
            <p>Sending reminders, collecting paperwork, answering FAQ-type questions — none of this requires your personal touch. Automate it so you can focus on what does.</p>

            <h3>2. Empower Managers</h3>
            <p>The manager relationship is the #1 predictor of new hire success. Give managers clear expectations and templates. Hold them accountable.</p>

            <h3>3. Make Self-Service Actually Good</h3>
            <p>New hires have 1,000 questions. If self-service sucks, you become the answer to all 1,000. Invest in tools that actually work.</p>

            <h3>4. Front-Load the Relationship Building</h3>
            <p>The stuff that requires you — culture conversations, concern resolution, relationship building — do it early when you have their attention.</p>

            <h2>The Onboarding KPIs That Matter</h2>

            <ul>
                <li><strong>Time to productivity:</strong> How quickly are new hires contributing?</li>
                <li><strong>90-day retention:</strong> Are you losing people right after investing in onboarding?</li>
                <li><strong>New hire NPS:</strong> Would they recommend your company to a friend?</li>
                <li><strong>Questions to HR:</strong> How many onboarding questions require your involvement?</li>
            </ul>

            <p>The last one is often overlooked. If new hires are constantly pinging you with basic questions, your onboarding isn't self-serve enough.</p>

            <h2>Final Thoughts</h2>

            <p>Good onboarding is the difference between a new hire who's productive in week 2 and one who's still confused in month 2. It's also the difference between retaining employees and losing them before you've recouped your recruiting costs.</p>

            <p>Use this checklist. Adapt it for your company. And invest in the tools and automation that let you scale onboarding without losing your mind.</p>
